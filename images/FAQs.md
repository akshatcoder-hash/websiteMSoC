- **What is the goal of Monsoon Season of Code?** <br>
Monsoon Season of Code (MSoC) is a program designed to bring new, excited contributors into open source communities, with the hope that they will continue to contribute to open source communities.

- **When will MSoC start?** <br>
It's a 2 week program starting from 8th September.

- **Why we are organising MSOC?** <br>
We committed to grow the open source ecosystem. The more open source developers there are in the world, the healthier and more sustainable the entire community will be.

- **Where does MSoC occur?** <br>
Monsoon Season of Code occurs **entirely online**; there is no requirement to travel as part of the program. **This event is exclusively for students of KIET Group Of Institutions**.

- **Can I participate in MSoC as both a mentor and a MSoC Contributor?** <br>
No. Mentors are people who have been involved in an Open Source Organization and wish to help guide new contributors to their community in the MSoC program. MSoC contributors are people who are new to an open source Organization.

- **Can a group submit a proposal together to work on a single project?** <br>
No, only an individual may work on a given project.

- **What are the prizes for the Contributors with most issues solved?** <br>
Contributor with most issues solved will get ₹ 3000 followed by ₹1500 and ₹1000 . Other Contributors will get swags depending upon the number of issues solved by them.

- **What if I have more questions?** <br>
